<!--
Notes: 1. We can use both class and id in div as well.
<div id="top" class=name">
in this way.
same goes for span also.
2. What happens in case of any conflict?
For example: if we used color:red in top and color: blue in name then at first the whole sentence
is red but then only top will show blue. Because, blue is more native to it as we used span over it.
